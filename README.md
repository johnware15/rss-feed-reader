# rss-feed-reader
RSS Feed Reader with Node and Vue.js

Building on our existing JavaScript and Vue.js experience, we will build a tool which we can deploy and continually update and work on into the future should we want to build new features or use it as a platform to try out new technology.

While there are many great  paid services out there for feed  readers, we already have  the tools and the ability to make our own and tailor  it to our needs. Even if we start with something small, weâ€™re owning our work and creating something practical for ourselves. We can then expand this idea and share with others to get ideas on new features we can add to our project.
